									<h4>Student Researcher @ Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, Purdue University</h4>
									<h4 class="col-4 col-6-xsmall">March 2022 - Present</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>I joined Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC) in March 2022. 
									When I joined, I did not have a lot of domain knowledge for the tasks 
									that I was assigned. However, I was able to learn a lot about the domain 
									and the tools that were used from the user guides that were provided to me 
									and from my mentor Dr. Amiya Maji's guidance. I am assisting Prof. Saurabh Bagchi 
									and Dr. Amiya Maji on the CCRI Project. I am responsible for setting up XDMoD/Supremm/XALT 
									data analysis pipeline. The overall objective of the project is to analyze cluster 
									utilization data to make better decisions while serving our users. 
									For this project, in the Fall 2022 semester, I was trained to use Unix 
									and Linux-based systems, to write bash scripts and perform benchmarking 
									through HPL and Stream.</p>

									<h4>Undergraduate Researcher @ Data Mine Learning Community, Purdue University </h4>
									<h4>Aug 2022 - Dec 2022</h4>
									<br>
									<p>I joined the Data Mine Learning Community in the Fall 2022 semester. I am collaborating with other undergraduate students 
										and working directly with the company “Webee” on their “Indoor Asset Tracking” project to pinpoint the location of 
										devices inside facilities. During the semester, as part of the trilateration team I am responsible for analysing and 
										parsing beacon and gateway datasets to perform triangulation and trilateration of the asset devices. This project aims to create
										a better way of tracking devices inside facilities that cannot be tracked easily using GPS. During the initial phase, my team
										members and I spent time gaining the neccessary domain knowledge for the project and thus, we researched about IOTs and 
										different communication protocols.</p>

									<h4>Student Researcher @ Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship , Prof. Aravind Machiry (PurS3 Labs) </h4>
									<h4>May 2022 - Aug 2022</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>Over the course of 10 weeks, I contribued to the research project titled "Gamification of Security Education in Programming Courses".
										The objective of the project is to create an efficient way of finding common security issues in student submissions using Fuzzing 
										and helping college students become aware of secure programming practices. Over the summer I developed skills in Fuzzing, 
										Linux-Based Systems, writing Bash Scripts, and running GitHub workflows and operating GitHub classrooms. 
										I tested and ran experiments on the GitHub workflows that were developed using the framework (created using AFL and 
										collaborating fuzzing) and I also added features to the workflows. Furthermore, at the end of my internship, I presented
										research paper titled “Seamless Integration of Security Education in Programming Courses” at the SURF Summer Symposium 2022.</p>
