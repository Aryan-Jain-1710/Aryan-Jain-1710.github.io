									<h4>Student Researcher @ Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, Purdue University</h4>
									<h4 class="col-4 col-6-xsmall">March 2022 - Present</h4>
									<br/>
									<p>I joined Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC) in March 2022. 
									When I joined, I did not have a lot of domain knowledge for the tasks 
									that I was assigned. However, I was able to learn a lot about the domain 
									and the tools that were used from the user guides that were provided to me 
									and from my mentor Dr. Amiya Maji's guidance. I am assisting Prof. Saurabh Bagchi 
									and Dr. Amiya Maji on the CCRI Project. I am responsible for setting up XDMoD/Supremm/XALT 
									data analysis pipeline. The overall objective of the project is to analyze cluster 
									utilization data to make better decisions while serving our users. 
									For this project, in the Fall 2022 semester, I was trained to use Unix 
									and Linux-based systems, to write bash scripts and perform benchmarking 
									through HPL and Stream.</p>
